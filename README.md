# cs50_public

This repository only showcases my CS50P portfolio for recruiters. I am in no way trying to leak answers.
Due to the security requirements of the original CS50 repository, I can't directly clone the entire repository,
thus, this repository only contains a small fraction of my progress in Harvard's CS50P program. 

**NOTE FOR TPEO: it would be greatly appreciated if you guys tell me when you have finished looking at this repository, as I would have to close this repository due to Harvard CS50's policy.**
